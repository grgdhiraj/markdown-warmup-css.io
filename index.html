            <h3>A Funny Story</h3>
            <p>Once I was traveling on a metro train, while talking to my Chinese friend over the phone in Chinese. Two school students entered the train at one of the stations, they stood next to me. And they were of Nepalese ethnicity, as I understood them talking to each other. While my destination was approaching, I stood up to get down to hear one of them telling the other one in Nepali, "Hey! This man has left a warm seat for us, let's sit!" And they exchanged a joke thinking that it maybe I had farted.
                I could not control the laughter, and I replied back asking them how did they know, in Nepali. They were shocked with eyes wide open while I laughed out loud. I got down from the train with a big smile on my face.</p>
            <h3>TL;DR</h3>
            <p>Look before you leap!</p>
